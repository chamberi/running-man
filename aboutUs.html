    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p> <img id="one" src="imgs/casey.jpg">Hi there, my name is Casey O'Kane. I went to culinary school after highschool and now I want to pursue coding at codefellows! I enjoy building and working with computers and I also really like dogs. Thank you for taking the time to visit our page! </p>
    <p> <img id="two" src="imgs/ford.jpg"> Having lived in California and Colorado, a quiet calling kept Ford wondering about whether to move to Seattle. After studying Geology at a University in Colorado, he decided to respond to his inner self by packing his bags and make the adventurous journey across the Rockies and become a Seattle transplant. At his arrival, he went straight to Code Fellows to sign up for an immersive development program. Soon afterward, he found 3 roommates to live with sharing one bathroom with a clogged shower drain. When not coding, he wanders around aimlessly.</p>
    <p> <img id="three" src="imgs/colin.png">Born and raised in Philadelphia, I went to high school in Rhode Island, college in Maine, and worked on Wall Street out of college. After a few years in New York City, I moved to Seattle to try something new. I started working in high-tech startups as soon as I arrived. Since then, I've conceived of, launched, and marketed B2B and B2C products for most of my career. But now I want more control to build my own applications. Thus, I'm here at CodeFellows to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
    <p> <img id="four" src="imgs/noah.jpg">Noah Gribbin is the illegitimate love child of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.  Abandoned at birth he spends the majority of his time evading G-Men sent to erase his legacy from the history books of the future.  Unperturbed, he marches onward, honing his skills to build the hottest websites the world has ever seen.</p>
